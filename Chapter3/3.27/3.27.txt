Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns an int value, which of the following definitions
are illegal? Explain why.
unsigned buf_size = 1024;
(a) int ia[buf_size]; //illegal, arrays must be initialized with a constexpr
(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14]; //legal, produces an array of size 14
(c) int ia[txt_size()]; //illegal, txt_size() is not a constexpr function so the result may not be produced at
compile time
(d) char st[11] = "fundamental"; //illegal, char array needs an empty character at end. Fundemental is 11 characters,
so one too long.

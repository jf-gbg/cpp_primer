Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?

vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;

The program will compile but ivec has not been initialized so has no element
at position 0. Running this program will cause a buffer overflow and result
in an error at runtime. Possible other solutions are below:

vector<int> ivec (1, 42);
vector<int> ivec {42};
vector<int> ivec;
ivec.push_back(42);

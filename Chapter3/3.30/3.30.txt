Exercise 3.30: Identify the indexing errors in the following code:

constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
    ia[ix] = ix;

//ix starts on 1 not 0 so will miss the first element.
//use of <= means ix will reach element 10 which is outside the bounds of the array
